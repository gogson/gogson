### 🚀 What I deliver

- 🎯 **From problem → prototype → product**: fast iterations with clear scope, trade-offs, and execution.
- 🎨 **Prototyping & UX**: Figma flows, clickable prototypes, UI specs, and pragmatic design-to-dev handoff.
- 🧱 **Full‑stack delivery**: build features end-to-end (JavaScript/TypeScript + Python), from UI to APIs.
- 🤖 **LLM integrations that ship**: turn model capabilities into real product features (UX, reliability, cost, and safety).
- 📊 **Data & search**: turn raw data into usable features (modeling, pipelines, indexing, analytics).
- 🔁 **CI/CD & reliability**: automated tests, reproducible builds, safe releases, and rollback-friendly deployments.
- 🧩 **Hybrid infrastructure**: ship to cloud + self-hosted environments (cost-aware, maintainable, observable).

- 🧠 **Wiki Game** — Cooperative mode where players guess hidden words from Wikipedia articles using neural semantic matching.
